	abstract = {Daily meteorological observations have been made in Uppsala, Sweden, since 1722, and complete series of air temperature and sea level air pressure have been reconstructed and homogenised for the period 1722–1998. The reconstruction work was based on the hand written registers and printed monthly bulletins before 1985, after which data was directly stored on computers. Methods to determine daily average temperatures from the typically available 2–3 observations per day were developed. These methods take into account observation times and cloud amount. Pressure reductions back to 1840 involved only routine calculations, while earlier pressure data needed major homogenisations. All data were searched for errors by comparisons with previously determined monthly averages and by different plotting techniques, mainly comparing with independently reconstructed data from Stockholm, 65 km south of Uppsala. This comparison also shows that the quality of the data is generally good, although the reliability is lower before the mid-19th century. Results are given illustrating changes in the daily average temperature and pressure climate on a 200–250 year time scale.},

Comparisons with independently reconstructed daily series for nearby Uppsala (1722–1998) show that the quality of the daily Stockholm data is good, although the reliability is lower before the mid-19th century. The daily temperature data show that the colder winter mean temperatures of the late 18th to early 19th centuries were connected with a particularly high frequency of very cold winter days. The warmer summers of the same period are more connected with a general shift of the temperature distribution towards higher temperatures than in the late 20th century.},

These cards represent the most comprehensive collection of digital material pertaining to these death certificates issued by Sonderstandesamt Arolsen, a German civil registry office. However, the reference cards can only be found dispersed throughout the Central Name Index ({CNI}), {ITS}’s 46+ million-card finding aid that is indexed only by name. Consequently, aggregating the death certificate reference cards for research requires an intractable manual search. I adopt template matching and machine learning to automate the retrieval of these cards from the {ITS} digital archive. I demonstrate the efficacy of my method on a test set of 22,117 hand-classified cards, reporting 100\% precision and 100\% recall. Running this algorithm on 39,967,358 scans of cards from the {CNI}, I identify 312,183 death certificate reference cards in 13.75 days of elapsed real runtime on a personal computer with only a single, \$600 Intel processor. Finally, I demonstrate that this approach can be generalized to many different card types within the {CNI}, showing great promise for application to other archives.},

We have designed a system capable of detecting an event by a triplet (time, place, action), and the ﬁrst published tweet concerning it if possible. We also show how tweets are grouped talking about the same event in order to bring more precision during the detection process of event date and location. Our system applies general linguistic analysis based on linguistic rules, and a semantic extraction guided by an events ontology. The two phases have been adapted for information extraction in the context of Twitter where messages are short and contain many abbreviations and misspellings. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, a sample of tweets will be tested on our system and a machine learning system.},

However, entity recognition from some historical corpora is much more diﬃcult than from natively digital text because of the marked presence of word errors and absence of page layout information. How diﬃcult can it be and what level of quality can be expected? We apply three typical extraction algorithms to the task of extracting person names from multiple types of noisy {OCR} documents found in the collection of a major genealogy content provider and compare their performance using a number of quality metrics. We also show an improvement in extraction quality using a majority-vote ensemble of the three extractors. We evaluate the extraction quality with respect to two references: what a human can manually extract from {OCR} output and from the original document images. We illustrate the challenges and opportunities at hand for extracting names from {OCRed} data and identify directions for further improvement.},

More specifically, it describes an effort to automatically discern the authorship of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in a body of uncorrected correspondence processed by {HTR} (Handwritten Text Recognition) and {OCR} (Optical Character Recognition), reporting on the effect this noise has on the analyses necessary to computationally identify the different writing style of the two brothers. In summary, our findings show that {OCR} digitization serves as a reliable proxy for the more painstaking process of manual digitization, at least when it comes to authorship attribution. Our results suggest that attribution is viable even when using training and test sets from different digitization pipelines. With regards to {HTR}, this research demonstrates that even though automated transcription significantly increases the risk of text misclassification when compared to {OCR}, a cleanliness above ≈ 20\% is already sufficient to achieve a higher-than-chance probability of correct binary attribution.},

As well as being of utility to climatologists, the daily recording of shipboard information can help illuminate a number of themes of interest to maritime and naval historians. More than this, however, such studies can help inform both more general and other specialized historical studies. Logbooks contain both anecdotal and statistical data relevant to the studies of medical historians, the history of science and navigation, social history, economic history, warfare, imperial history and of course environmental history. Moreover, many of these themes can be studied in a multi-national context and furthermore, if studied in a multidisciplinary context, can offer many useful insights.},

	abstract = {Several thousand ships’ logbooks have survived from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They provide a valuable source of climatic information. This paper takes the Battle of Trafalgar as an example of how this source can be used to provide a better knowledge and understanding of weather and climate from those distant times. The reliability of the non-instrumental climatic records of the logbooks is conﬁrmed and a simple statistical measure is used to quantify their degree of consistency. Reconstructions of daily weather patterns are made and a zonal index is calculated to represent the circulation patterns of the region. The movements of pressure systems are plotted and indicate that the zonal index was negative (air pressure increasing from south to north) for most of the month. The storm that followed the battle is identiﬁed as one of notable severity. This extreme behaviour is interpreted within the context of longer-term aspects of the contemporary climate.},

The results are described using a variety of descriptive summary statistics. In general, wind force records are highly correlated and wind direction differences are relatively small compared with the natural variability of this phenomenon. Wind directions were studied and found to have a bias towards 4-, 8- and 16-point compass readings at the expense of 32-point readings. Corrections were needed to convert the recorded directions, which were made by reference to magnetic north, to their true north equivalents.},

Using the concept of dynamical downscaling, development during recent decades, when sufﬁciently good and homogeneous weather data exist, has been ‘‘reconstructed,’’ and scenarios of possible future change are described. ‘‘Localization’’ allows estimation of changes at speciﬁc sites, e.g., harbors. As local water-level statistics depend not only on climate variations but also on local modiﬁcations of the local bathymetry, new options for adaptation emerge. For the case of Hamburg, an option for such future adaptations is discussed.},

This approach may be especially useful when an overlapping period between documentary and instrumental data is not available. On the other hand, the method avoids use artificial statistical procedures to rescale the reconstructed series and overcome the problem of the loss of variance. The methodology allows reconstruct changes in the mean value and standard deviation of the climate variables. It is based on accounting the number of extreme events in past, and inferring mean value and standard deviation using the assumption of normal distribution for the climatic variables. The application of the method is only possible if a sufficient number of events is recorded in the data base. It is useful to reconstruct changes in the long-time scale, using at least decadal periods as time units. The method is applied to winter rainfall series corresponding to 30-year periods in Andalusia (southern Spain), obtaining results comparable with those of previous analysis.},

	abstract = {This study ﬁlls an important gap in south-eastern Australia’s climate record by compiling qualitative historical data from the time of ﬁrst European settlement of Australia in 1788 until widespread meteorological observations become available in 1860. In this study, we consolidate twelve documentary-based rainfall chronologies for ﬁve sub-regions of south-eastern Australia ({SEA}) over the 1788–1860 period using a range of secondary historical sources. Our analysis identiﬁed 27 drought years in {SEA} between 1788 and 1860, and 14 years of high rainfall in New South Wales ({NSW}) between 1788 and 1840. Given that our current understanding of Australian drought is still largely conﬁned to the post-1900 period covered by instrumental records, we provide an outline of the drought and wet periods to provide a consolidated reference of historical accounts of lesser known pre-instrumental rainfall variations for researchers working in the ﬁeld. This index is also intended to serve as an independent inter-annual veriﬁcation source for palaeoclimate reconstructions being developed in the Australian region. This study conﬁrms that {SEA} has experienced considerable rainfall variability that has inﬂuenced past Australian societies since the ﬁrst European settlement in 1788. Of the droughts identiﬁed in this study, 1837–1841 was the longest and most widespread event inﬂuencing all subregions. The 1793–1809 period was particularly wet, with periods of heavy rainfall often resulting in devastating ﬂoods on the Hawkesbury River region of Sydney. Despite the geographical biases present in the documentary material, it is clear that historical records provide important information on rainfall variations in {SEA} and their societal impacts over the 1788–1860 pre-instrumental period. The results presented here provide an important basis for developing an extended rainfall index for eastern {NSW} from 1788–2008, and is the subject of part 2 of this study (Gergis J, Ashcroft L. 2012.

Methods to determine daily average temperatures from the typically available 2–3 observations per day were developed. These methods take into account observation times and cloud amount. Pressure reductions back to 1840 involved only routine calculations, while earlier pressure data needed major homogenisations. All data were searched for errors by comparisons with previously determined monthly averages and by different plotting techniques, mainly comparing with independently reconstructed data from Stockholm, 65 km south of Uppsala. This comparison also shows that the quality of the data is generally good, although the reliability is lower before the mid-19th century. Results are given illustrating changes in the daily average temperature and pressure climate on a 200–250 year time scale.},

	abstract = {Abstract Instrumental meteorological measurements from periods prior to the start of national weather services are designated “early instrumental data.” They have played an important role in climate research as they allow daily to decadal variability and changes of temperature, pressure, and precipitation, including extremes, to be addressed. Early instrumental data can also help place twenty-first century climatic changes into a historical context such as defining preindustrial climate and its variability. Until recently, the focus was on long, high-quality series, while the large number of shorter series (which together also cover long periods) received little to no attention. The shift in climate and climate impact research from mean climate characteristics toward weather variability and extremes, as well as the success of historical reanalyses that make use of short series, generates a need for locating and exploring further early instrumental measurements. However, information on early instrumental series has never been electronically compiled on a global scale. Here we attempt a worldwide compilation of metadata on early instrumental meteorological records prior to 1850 (1890 for Africa and the Arctic). Our global inventory comprises information on several thousand records, about half of which have not yet been digitized (not even as monthly means), and only approximately 20\% of which have made it to global repositories. The inventory will help to prioritize data rescue efforts and can be used to analyze the potential feasibility of historical weather data products. The inventory will be maintained as a living document and is a first, critical, step toward the systematic rescue and reevaluation of these highly valuable early records. Additions to the inventory are welcome.},

	abstract = {Storms occasionally bring havoc to Northwest Europe. At present, a single storm may cause damage of up to 7 billion U.S.\$, of which a substantial part is insured. One scenario of climate change indicates that storm intensity in Northwest Europe could increase by 1–9\% because of the doubling of {CO}2 concentrations in the atmosphere. A geographic-explicit, statistical model, based on recent storms and storm damage data for the Netherlands, shows that an increase of 2\% in wind intensity by the year 2015 could lead to a 50\% increase in storm damage to houses and businesses. Only 20\% of the increase is due to population and economic growth. A 6\% increase could even triple the damage. A simpler model – based on national average data and combined with a stochastic storm generator – shows that the average annual damage could increase by 80\% with a 2\% increase in wind intensity. A 6\% wind intensity increase could lead to an average annual damage increase of 500\%. The damage in Northwest Europe is about a factor 6 higher than the damage in the Netherlands. Little potential seems to exist for reducing the vulnerability to storms in the Netherlands. More attention should be given to planning at the government level for disaster relief and to the development of coping strategies.},

The reconstructions are based on regression equations developed using similar data from the {ICOADS} dataset. Although the regression relationships developed over a calibration period (1881–1940) work almost as well over an independent veriﬁcation period (1941–1997), application to the earlier 1750–1850 period results in barely statistically signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcients when compared with a number of other {NAO} and {SOI} reconstructions from other proxy and long instrumental sources. A number of possibilities are investigated to attempt to determine the cause, the most likely of which is that the number of observations available for the {CLIWOC} period is just too low in some regions. As large numbers of ships’ logbooks remain to be digitised, the regression relationships will prove useful to focus effort in future digitisation endeavours.},

The geographic range of the undertaking is conﬁned to the English Channel and its western approaches where the abundance of logbooks for this period allows for the abstraction of a daily series of wind force and direction data. These are veriﬁed and processed for inclusion in a database from which indices are derived for air circulation patterns based on the frequency of winds from north, east, south and west quarters, and of gale frequency, based on the contemporary terminology of wind force. The methods by which the data are abstracted and processed are described, as is the nature of the raw data and source material. The results provide a uniquely detailed insight into the changing patterns of air circulation over this critical period that marked the transition from the depths of the Little Ice Age in the late seventeenth century. Attention is also drawn to the changing nature of gale frequency, which revealed a notable decrease over the study period. Associations between changing circulation patterns and temperature regimes are also explored.},

After discussing several related algorithms, I present a novel approach to the problem that employs a scoring scheme for computing phonetic similarity between phonetic segments on the basis of multivalued articulatory phonetic features. The scheme incorporates the key concept of feature salience, which is necessary to properly balance the importance of various features. The new algorithm combines several techniques developed for sequence comparison: an extended set of edit operations, local and semiglobal modes of alignment, and the capability of retrieving a set of near-optimal alignments. On a set of 82 cognate pairs, it performs better than comparable algorithms reported in the literature.},

For digital corpora of historical prints, the errors are further exacerbated due to low scan quality and lack of language standardization. For the task of {OCR} post-hoc correction, we propose a neural approach based on a combination of recurrent ({RNN}) and deep convolutional network ({ConvNet}) to correct {OCR} transcription errors. At character level we flexibly capture errors, and decode the corrected output based on a novel attention mechanism. Accounting for the input and output similarity, we propose a new loss function that rewards the model's correcting behavior. Evaluation on a historical book corpus in German language shows that our models are robust in capturing diverse {OCR} transcription errors and reduce the word error rate of 32.3\% by more than 89\%.},

Experimental results from the {NER} task are described, with emphasis on dealing with nested entities using a multi-word token method. The overall objective is to improve access by non-specialist users to a valuable cultural resource.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an extended overview of the ﬁrst edition of {HIPE} (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities), a pioneering shared task dedicated to the evaluation of named entity processing on historical newspapers in French, German and English. Since its introduction some twenty years ago, named entity ({NE}) processing has become an essential component of virtually any text mining application and has undergone major changes. Recently, two main trends characterise its developments: the adoption of deep learning architectures and the consideration of textual material originating from historical and cultural heritage collections. While the former opens up new opportunities, the latter introduces new challenges with heterogeneous, historical and noisy inputs. In this context, the objective of {HIPE}, run as part of the {CLEF} 2020 conference, is threefold: strengthening the robustness of existing approaches on non-standard inputs, enabling performance comparison of {NE} processing on historical texts, and, in the long run, fostering eﬃcient semantic indexing of historical documents. Tasks, corpora, and results of 13 participating teams are presented. Compared to the condensed overview [31], this paper includes further details about data generation and statistics, additional information on participating systems, and the presentation of complementary results.},

Our work enables the automatic extraction of biological information previously buried in the mass of papers and volumes. For this purpose, we generated training data for the tasks of Named Entity Recognition ({NER}) and Taxa Recognition ({TR}) in biological documents. We use this data to train a number of leading machine learning tools and create a gold standard for {TR} in biodiversity literature. More specifically, we perform a practical analysis of our newly generated {BIOfid} dataset through various downstream-task evaluations and establish a new state of the art for {TR} with 80.23\% F-score. In this sense, our paper lays the foundations for future work in the field of information extraction in biology texts.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in language modeling using recurrent neural networks have made it viable to model language as distributions over characters. By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous embeddings and find that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition ({NER}), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the {CoNLL}03 shared task. We release all code and pre-trained language models in a simple-to-use framework to the research community, to enable reproduction of these experiments and application of our proposed embeddings to other tasks: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair},

In this, a wide variety of legal, logistical, technical and other challenges were encountered. After introducing the background issues in newspaper digitization in Europe, the paper discusses the technical aspects of refinement in greater detail.

If this represents a huge step forward in terms of preservation and accessibility, the next fundamental challenge– and real promise of digitization– is to exploit the contents of these digital assets, and therefore to adapt and develop appropriate language technologies to search and retrieve information from this `Big Data of the Past'. Yet, the application of text processing tools on historical documents in general, and historical newspapers in particular, poses new challenges, and crucially requires appropriate language resources. In this context, this paper presents a collection of historical newspaper data sets composed of text and image resources, curated and published within the context of the `impresso - Media Monitoring of the Past' project. With corpora, benchmarks, semantic annotations and language models in French, German and Luxembourgish covering ca. 200 years, the objective of the impresso resource collection is to contribute to historical language resources, and thereby strengthen the robustness of approaches to non-standard inputs and foster efficient processing of historical documents.},

The special case of measuring coherence of topics has been recently studied to remedy the problem that topic models give no guaranty on the interpretablity of their output. Several benchmark datasets were produced that record human judgements of the interpretability of topics. We are the ﬁrst to propose a framework that allows to construct existing word based coherence measures as well as new ones by combining elementary components. We conduct a systematic search of the space of coherence measures using all publicly available topic relevance data for the evaluation. Our results show that new combinations of components outperform existing measures with respect to correlation to human ratings. Finally, we outline how our results can be transferred to further applications in the context of text mining, information retrieval and the world wide web.},

	shorttitle = {Humanities data analysis},
	abstract = {"The use of quantitative methods in the humanities and related social sciences has increased considerably in recent years, allowing researchers to discover patterns in a vast range of source materials. Despite this growth, there are few resources addressed to students and scholars who wish to take advantage of these powerful tools. Humanities Data Analysis offers the first intermediate-level guide to quantitative data analysis for humanities students and scholars using the Python programming language. This practical textbook, which assumes a basic knowledge of Python, teaches readers the necessary skills for conducting humanities research in the rapidly developing digital environment. The book begins with an overview of the place of data science in the humanities, and proceeds to cover data carpentry: the essential techniques for gathering, cleaning, representing, and transforming textual and tabular data. Then, drawing from real-world, publicly available data sets that cover a variety of scholarly domains, the book delves into detailed case studies. Focusing on textual data analysis, the authors explore such diverse topics as network analysis, genre theory, onomastics, literacy, author attribution, mapping, stylometry, topic modeling, and time series analysis. Exercises and resources for further reading are provided at the end of each chapter. An ideal resource for humanities students and scholars aiming to take their Python skills to the next level, Humanities Data Analysis illustrates the benefits that quantitative methods can bring to complex research questions. Appropriate for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and scholars with a basic knowledge of Python. Applicable to many humanities disciplines, including history, literature, and sociology. Offers real-world case studies using publicly available data sets. Provides exercises at the end of each chapter for students to test acquired skills. Emphasizes visual storytelling via data visualizations"–},

Our work aims at shedding light on the complex concept of events when dealing with historical texts. More specifically, we introduce new annotation guidelines for event mentions and types, categorized into 22 classes. Then, we annotate a historical corpus accordingly, and compare two approaches for automatic event detection and classification following this novel scheme. We believe that this work can foster research in a field of inquiry as yet underestimated in the area of Temporal Information Processing. To this end, we release new annotation guidelines, a corpus, and new models for automatic annotation.},

Messages posted on Twitter (tweets) have been reporting everything from daily life stories to the latest local and global news and events. Monitoring and analyzing this rich and continuous user-generated content can yield unprecedentedly valuable information, enabling users and organizations to acquire actionable knowledge. This article provides a survey of techniques for event detection from Twitter streams. These techniques aim at finding real-world occurrences that unfold over space and time. In contrast to conventional media, event detection from Twitter streams poses new challenges. Twitter streams contain large amounts of meaningless messages and polluted content, which negatively affect the detection performance. In addition, traditional text mining techniques are not suitable, because of the short length of tweets, the large number of spelling and grammatical errors, and the frequent use of informal and mixed language. Event detection techniques presented in literature address these issues by adapting techniques from various fields to the uniqueness of Twitter. This article classifies these techniques according to the event type, detection task, and detection method and discusses commonly used features. Finally, it highlights the need for public benchmarks to evaluate the performance of different detection approaches and various features.},

Previous approaches have heavily depended on language-specific knowledge and preexisting natural language processing tools. However, not all languages have such resources and tools available compared with English language. A more promising approach is to automatically learn effective features from data, without relying on language-specific resources. In this study, we develop a language-independent neural network to capture both sequence and chunk information from specific contexts and use them to train an event detector for multiple languages without any manually encoded features. Experiments show that our approach can achieve robust, efficient and accurate results for various languages. In the {ACE} 2005 English event detection task, our approach achieved a 73.4\% F-score with an average of 3.0\% absolute improvement compared with state-of-the-art.

It includes three chief areas of inquiry: the study of material environmental history, political and policy-related environmental history, and a form of environmental history which concerns what humans have thought, believed, written, and more rarely, painted, sculpted, sung, or danced that deals with the relationship between society and nature. Since 1980, environmental history has come to flourish in many corners of the world, and scholars everywhere have found models, approaches, and perspectives rather different from those developed for the {US} context.},

Further, methods and signiﬁcant results of historical-climatological research, mainly achieved since 1990, are presented. The main focus concentrates on data, methods, deﬁnitions of the “Medieval Warm Period” and the “Little Ice Age”, synoptic interpretation of past climates, climatic anomalies and natural disasters, and the vulnerability of economies and societies to climate as well as images and social representations of past weather and climate. The potential of historical climatology for climate modelling research is discussed brieﬂy. Research perspectives in historical climatology are formulated with reference to data, methods, interdisciplinarity and impacts.},

Within this review, we focus on the identification and interpretation of causal links between changes in climate and in human societies. A revised climate–society impact order model of historical climate–society interactions is presented and applied to structure the findings of the past 20 years' scholarship. Despite considerable progress in research about past climate–society relations, partly expedited by new palaeoclimate data, we identify limitations to knowledge, including geographical biases, a disproportional attention to extremely cold periods, and a focus on crises. Furthermore, recent scholarship shows that the limitations with particular disciplinary approaches can be successfully overcome through interdisciplinary collaborations. We conclude the article by proposing recommendations for future directions of research in the climatic change–human history nexus.

	abstract = {This paper provides a critical analysis of recent climate history (or historical climatology) scholarship. It identifies four key subfields in this historiography of climate change. First, it examines scholarship on climate reconstructions that use a variety of innovative historical sources to document past climatic conditions. Second, it analyzes scholarship on social impacts and responses to climate change. This literature is prolific with significant attention given to climatic variability and climatic or weather-related disasters. Third, the paper discusses research on the uses and abuses of climate knowledge, such as innovations in meteorology and climatology as well as ways that Western climate knowledge helped justify colonialism and perpetuate racism. Fourth, the paper examines research on cultural constructions and perceptions of climate. This includes analysis of diverse climatic understandings and climate narratives that have varied across time and space. While the climate historiography is steadily expanding and constantly probing new areas, this paper contends that the field overall would benefit from a stronger emphasis on social history to examine race, class, and gender in climate history while also focusing on how social relations and power dynamics affect human–climate interactions. Additionally, it argues that the uncovering of more diverse climate meanings and narratives, partly through better social history, could both enrich the historiography and contribute to today's broader discussions about global climate change in the past and future. {WIREs} Clim Change 2012 doi: 10.1002/wcc.171 This article is categorized under: Climate, History, Society, Culture {\textgreater} Disciplinary Perspectives},

	abstract = {Ideas and knowledge about climate have changed considerably in history. Ancient philosophers like Hippocrates and Aristotle shaped the understandings of climate, which remained very influential until well into the eighteenth century. The Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century gave rise to new ways of systematic instrument-based observation of and increased public interest in weather and climate. These developments led to a mechanistic understanding and a reductionist physical description of climate in the twentieth century, eventually in the form of a complex earth system. Furthermore, different understandings of climate co-existed in many periods of time. Only in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries specific scientific concepts of climate (a geographical understanding of climate in climatology until about the mid-twentieth century and a physical understanding of climate in climate science in the second half of the twentieth century) gained superior social credibility and cultural dominance. The understanding of climate involved more than the accumulation of scientific knowledge. It was rooted in social processes and cultural interests, which shaped different ideas of climate in different communities of actors and different historical times.

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a growth in scholarship on the intertwined histories of climate, science, and European imperialism. Scholarship has focused both on how the material realities of climate shaped colonial enterprises, and on how ideas about climate informed imperial ideologies. Historians have shown how European expansion was justified by its protagonists with theories of racial superiority, which were often closely tied to ideas of climatic determinism. Meanwhile, the colonial spaces established by European powers offered novel “laboratories” where ideas about acclimatization and climatic improvement could be tested on the ground. While historical scholarship has focused on how powerful ideas of climate informed imperial projects, emerging scholarship in environmental history, history of science, and historical geography focuses instead on the material and cognitive practices by which the climates of colonial spaces were made known and dealt with in fields such as forestry, agriculture, and human health. These heretofore rather disparate areas of historical research carry great contemporary relevance for studies of how climates and their changes have been understood, debated, and adapted to in the past.

	abstract = {During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the newspaper press was the leading public forum in the protracted debate over the supposed climatological effects of forests. Journalists acted as key intermediaries in the dispute between parliament, science and the public. The press was also a powerful pressure group in its own right. Newspaper reports contextualised the forest influence issue by linking it to three interrelated concerns: the cause of climate variability and change, the environmental impact of humans, and the need for forest conservation. This paper examines the role of the Australasian press in the debate along with the changing nature of the arguments and some aspects of its historical geography. Results are summarised from a systematic longitudinal survey that analysed over 1400 articles relevant to the forest influence debate published in 141 Australian and New Zealand newspapers between the years 1827 and 1956. The study concludes that the press was instrumental in politicising all sides of the debate and later in perpetuating it in popular culture long after both governments and institutional science had dismissed the idea that humans could alter climates by manipulating forests.},

Furthermore, {UMAP} has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

Researchers have published many articles in the field of topic modeling and applied in various fields such as software engineering, political science, medical and linguistic science, etc. There are various methods for topic modelling; Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}) is one of the most popular in this field. Researchers have proposed various models based on the {LDA} in topic modeling. According to previous work, this paper will be very useful and valuable for introducing {LDA} approaches in topic modeling. In this paper, we investigated highly scholarly articles (between 2003 to 2016) related to topic modeling based on {LDA} to discover the research development, current trends and intellectual structure of topic modeling. In addition, we summarize challenges and introduce famous tools and datasets in topic modeling based on {LDA}.},

	abstract = {Topic modeling is used for discovering latent semantic structure, usually referred to as topics, in a large collection of documents. The most widely used methods are Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis. Despite their popularity they have several weaknesses. In order to achieve optimal results they often require the number of topics to be known, custom stop-word lists, stemming, and lemmatization. Additionally these methods rely on bag-of-words representation of documents which ignore the ordering and semantics of words. Distributed representations of documents and words have gained popularity due to their ability to capture semantics of words and documents. We present \${\textbackslash}texttt\{top2vec\}\$, which leverages joint document and word semantic embedding to find \${\textbackslash}textit\{topic vectors\}\$. This model does not require stop-word lists, stemming or lemmatization, and it automatically finds the number of topics. The resulting topic vectors are jointly embedded with the document and word vectors with distance between them representing semantic similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that \${\textbackslash}texttt\{top2vec\}\$ finds topics which are significantly more informative and representative of the corpus trained on than probabilistic generative models.},

For obtaining a “flat” partition consisting of only the most significant clusters (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds), we propose a novel cluster stability measure, formalize the problem of maximizing the overall stability of selected clusters, and formulate an algorithm that computes an optimal solution to this problem. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current, state-of-the-art, density-based clustering methods on a wide variety of real world data.},

	abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships.  In this paper we present several improvements that make the Skip-gram model more expressive and enable it to learn higher quality vectors more rapidly.  We show that by subsampling frequent words we obtain significant speedup,  and also learn higher quality representations as measured by our tasks. We also introduce Negative Sampling, a simplified variant of Noise Contrastive Estimation ({NCE}) that learns more accurate vectors for frequent words compared to the hierarchical softmax.   An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases.  For example, the meanings of Canada'' and "Air'' cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada''.  Motivated by this example, we present a simple and efficient method for finding phrases, and show that their vector representations can be accurately learned by the Skip-gram model. "},
