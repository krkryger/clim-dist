This is the repo of my master's project at the Ecole nationale des chartes (Paris). The goal of this thesis is to experiment with digital methods to examine the presence of climate and weather-related information in a large corpus of digitized journals from the 19th century. Distributional methods are used to study the frequence of weather phenomena in the press and topic modeling is applied to categorize these mentions into a number of frequent contexts. The memoire details the role of the press as a source for climate history and offers ways to exploit it more efficiently.
